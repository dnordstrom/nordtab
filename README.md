# NORDtab

The simplest `about:newtab` page I could make. Just a Nord colored blank page (light or dark depending on browser setting). Adding a `#photo` location hash gives a random gray-scale background photo from Unsplash via unsplash.it.

## Why?

Because I use Tridactyl or the URL bar to navigate but add-ons don't work on `about:newtab`, and `about:blank` requires a `userContent.css` to change the color. This way I can hit Ctrl-T and still use add-ons from there, on a page I can change with a simple location hash depending on mood, instead of using yet another add-on or website with tons of features I don't need.
